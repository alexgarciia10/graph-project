graph - Graph data structure

This module contains a Graph class for creating and working with graphs. The graph is stored using an adjacency map. 
The graph can be directed or undirected and supports adding vertices and edges, labeling, basic graph queries, removing vertices and edges, and coloring vertices and edges.

The main class in this module is Graph. The Graph class uses two nested classes, Vertex and Edge, to represent the vertices and edges in the graph.


Creating a graph


class Graph(directed=False)
    Create an empty graph
    If directed is False, then the graph is undirected.
    If directed is True, the graph is directed.


Adding Vertices and edges


Graph.add_vertex(label=None)
    Create a new vertex and add it to the graph.
    The vertex is stored in the adjacency map and returned.
    
Graph.add_edge(origin, destination, label=None)
    Create a new edge from origin to destination and add it to the graph.
    The edge is stored in the adjacency map and returned.
    Raises TypeError if origin or destination is not a Graph.Vertex.
    
    
Label methods


Graph.set_vertex_label(vertex, label)
    Set the label value stored on a vertex.
    Raises TypeError if vertex is not a Graph.Vertex.

Graph.get_vertex_label(vertex)
    Return the label value stored on a vertex.
    Raises TypeError if vertex is not a Graph.Vertex.

Graph.set_edge_label(edge, label)
    Set the label value stored on an edge.
    Raises TypeError if edge is not a Graph.Edge.

Graph.get_edge_label(edge)
    Return the label value stored on an edge.
    Raises TypeError if edge is not a Graph.Edge.

Graph.set_label(thing, label)
    Set the label of either a vertex or an edge.
    Raises TypeError if thing is not a Graph.Vertex or Graph.Edge.

Graph.get_label(thing)
    Return the label of either a vertex or an edge.
    Raises TypeError if thing is not a Graph.Vertex or Graph.Edge.
    

Graph query methods


Graph.vertices()
    Return a set of all vertices.

Graph.edges()
    Return a set of all edges.

Graph.vertex_count()
    Return the number of vertices.

Graph.edge_count()
    Return the number of edges.

Graph.adjacent(origin, destination, outgoing=True)
    Return the edge between origin and destination, or None.

Graph.neighbors(vertex, outgoing=True)
    Return the neighboring vertices of a vertex.

Graph.degree(vertex, outgoing=True)
    Return the degree of a vertex.

Graph.incident_edges(vertex, outgoing=True)
    Return the edges connected to a vertex.
    
    
Removal methods


Graph.remove_edge(edge)
Graph.remove_edge(origin, destination)
    Remove an edge from the graph.
    If the edge does not exist then no changes are made.

Graph.remove_vertex(vertex)
    Remove a vertex and all connected edges.

Graph.remove(obj)
    Remove either a vertex or an edge.


Coloring methods


Graph.greedy_vertex_coloring()
    Assign colors to vertices so that adjacent vertices do not share the same color.
    Colors are stored as non-negative integers.
    
Graph.greedy_edge_coloring()
    Assign colors to edges so that edges sharing a vertex do not share the same color.
    Colors are stored as non-negative integers.
    

Examples

graph example:
    
    G = graph.Graph()
    a = G.add_vertex("A")
    b = G.add_vertex("B")
    G.add_edge(a, b)
    
    print(G.vertex_count())
    
coloring example:
    
    G = graph.Graph()
    v1 = G.add_vertex("1")
    v2 = G.add_vertex("2")
    v3 = G.add_vertex("3")
    
    G.add_edge(v1, v2)
    G.add_edge(v2, v3)
    G.add_edge(v1, v3)
    
    G.greedy_vertex_coloring()
    print(v1.get_color(), v2.get_color(), v3.get_color())
