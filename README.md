# Graph Data Structure (Python)

This project implements a graph data structure using an adjacency map representation.
It was developed to reinforce core concepts in data structures and algorithms, including
object-oriented design, traversal logic, and performance considerations.

## Features
- Vertex and edge abstractions
- Adjacency map representation
- Graph insertion, removal, and lookup operations
- Clean, modular Python design

## Technologies
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Graph Theory
